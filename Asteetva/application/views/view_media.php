		<h5>Interview with Psycho Store founder Ishkaran Singh : </h5>
		<p>Gaming accessories are tough to come by in India and importing them usually costs a lot more than what my meager wallet can bear. So when I first met Psycho Store's founder, Ishkaran Singh, his idea for bringing in gaming merchandise and accessories to India excited me, especially so considering it wasn't burning a hole in my wallet! A couple of months later, I had another chance to meet Ishkaran, but this time I had a pen and paper.<br><br>

		Read on for his experiences in gaming and his steps to becoming a brand owner!
